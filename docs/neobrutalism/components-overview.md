# Neobrutalism component overview

The Neobrutalism library mirrors the shadcn/ui API while layering the bold color, box-shadow, and type treatments that define the design system. Use the following catalogue as a quick reference for which primitives exist and the problems they solve before assembling pages. Each entry links to the canonical docs on [neobrutalism.dev](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/docs).
