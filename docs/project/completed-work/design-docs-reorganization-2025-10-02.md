# Design System Documentation Reorganization

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Related Task**: Documentation cleanup and organization

## Summary

Reorganized design system documentation to create a clear, maintainable structure with current implementation references separated from historical/archived material.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Moved Documents

| From | To | Reason |
|------|-----|--------|
| `docs/figma-export-review.md` | `docs/design-system/prototype-analysis.md` | Better location + clearer name |
| `docs/dark-mode-fix.md` | `docs/archive/` | Completed work, superseded by `progress/p0-001.md` |
| `docs/neobrutalism-daisyui-implementation.md` | `docs/archive/` | Outdated approach (tailwind.config vs CSS-based) |

### 2. Created New Documents

#### `docs/design-system/implementation.md`
**Purpose**: Current, accurate implementation reference

**Content**:
- Three-layer customization strategy
- Visual system specification (borders, shadows, colors, spacing)
- Complete code patterns and examples
- Dark mode implementation
- Automatic styling system
- Troubleshooting guide
- Component development patterns

**Why**: The archived `neobrutalism-daisyui-implementation.md` proposed an outdated approach (using `tailwind.config.mjs` with DaisyUI config) while the actual implementation uses DaisyUI 5's CSS-based theme system (via `@plugin "daisyui/theme"`). This new document accurately reflects what was built in P0-001.

#### `docs/design-system/README.md`
**Purpose**: Navigation and status tracking for design system docs

**Content**:
- Quick navigation guides
- Document status table
- Purpose of each document
- Cross-references to related docs
- Maintenance notes

### 3. Updated Existing Documents

#### Updated `docs/design-system/prototype-analysis.md`
- Added header with status (Reference Material)
- Added warning note that it's reference only
- Clarified difference between prototype and implementation
- Cross-referenced implementation.md

#### Updated `docs/README.md`
- Replaced references to moved documents
- Updated design system section with new structure:
  - `guide.md` - Design philosophy
  - `implementation.md` - Technical reference
  - `prototype-analysis.md` - Pattern extraction
  - `colors.md` - Color system

#### Updated `docs/archive/README.md`
- Added `dark-mode-fix.md` and `neobrutalism-daisyui-implementation.md` to archive list
- Updated "Current Active Documents" section with new locations
- Added notes explaining why documents were archived

```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Clear Separation of Concerns

**Current Implementation** (`design-system/implementation.md`):
- ✅ Accurate technical reference
- ✅ Reflects P0-001 work
- ✅ Uses correct DaisyUI 5 CSS approach
- ✅ Complete code examples

**Design Philosophy** (`design-system/guide.md`):
- ✅ Design principles and rationale
- ✅ Component architecture patterns
- ✅ Not tied to specific implementation

**Reference Material** (`design-system/prototype-analysis.md`):
- ✅ Pattern extraction from prototype
- ✅ Clearly marked as reference
- ✅ Migration strategies documented

**Historical** (`archive/`):
- ✅ Completed fix notes
- ✅ Outdated approaches
- ✅ Available for historical reference

### 2. Documentation Consistency

All design system docs now:
- Have status indicators (✅ Current, 📖 Reference, 🗄️ Archived)
- Cross-reference related documents
- Specify their purpose and audience
- Link to implementation files

### 3. Clear Navigation

The new `design-system/README.md` provides:
- **For Implementation**: Direct path to current technical docs
- **For Design Decisions**: Path to philosophy and rationale
- **For New Components**: Workflow and pattern references
- **Document Status Table**: Quick overview of what's current vs reference

### 4. Reduced Confusion

Previously:
- ❌ `neobrutalism-daisyui-implementation.md` showed outdated approach
- ❌ `figma-export-review.md` unclear if it was implementation or reference
- ❌ `dark-mode-fix.md` duplicated information in `progress/p0-001.md`
- ❌ No clear entry point for design system docs

Now:
- ✅ `implementation.md` shows **actual** implementation
- ✅ `prototype-analysis.md` clearly marked as reference material
- ✅ Dark mode docs consolidated (detailed in progress/, reference in implementation.md)
- ✅ Clear README navigation in design-system folder

## Document Status Overview

| Document | Status | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| `design-system/implementation.md` | ✅ Current | Technical implementation reference | Developers building components |
| `design-system/guide.md` | 📖 Reference | Design philosophy and architecture | Designers and developers |
| `design-system/colors.md` | ✅ Current | Color specification | All |
| `design-system/prototype-analysis.md` | 📖 Reference | Pattern extraction | Developers migrating patterns |
| `archive/neobrutalism-daisyui-implementation.md` | 🗄️ Archived | Outdated implementation approach | Historical reference only |
| `archive/dark-mode-fix.md` | 🗄️ Archived | Dark mode implementation notes | Superseded by progress/p0-001.md |
