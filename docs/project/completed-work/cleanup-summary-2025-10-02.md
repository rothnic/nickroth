## What's Different

### Before Cleanup
- 16 markdown files in root docs folder
- Mix of active docs, completed fixes, and troubleshooting notes
- Hard to find relevant information
- No clear indication of what's done vs in-progress

### After Cleanup
- 9 markdown files in root docs folder (44% reduction)
- Clear separation: active vs archived
- Easy to find completion status (progress/ folder)
- Quick reference available (p0-001-quick-reference.md)
- All fix notes archived but accessible

## Key Documents to Reference

### For Next Component (P0-002+)
1. **Primary Workflow**: `.github/prompts/buildComponent2.prompt.md` (updated with P0-001 learnings)
2. **Quick Reference**: `docs/p0-001-quick-reference.md` (design values, common issues)
3. **Component Backlog**: `docs/component-backlog.md` (find next task)

### For Understanding What's Done
1. **Complete Details**: `docs/progress/p0-001.md` (full technical documentation)
2. **Quick Summary**: `docs/p0-001-quick-reference.md` (one-page overview)

### For Historical Reference
1. **Archive Folder**: `docs/archive/` (all completed fix notes)
2. **Archive README**: `docs/archive/README.md` (explains what's there)

## Benefits

### For AI Agents
- Clear entry point: buildComponent2.prompt.md has all learnings integrated
- Quick reference available for common patterns
- No confusion from outdated troubleshooting docs
- Easy to find completion status

### For Human Developers
- Organized structure makes navigation easier
- Quick reference provides immediate answers
- Full details available when needed
- Historical context preserved but out of the way

### For Future Work
- Templates for documenting future tasks (progress/ folder)
- Clear pattern for archiving completed work
- Quick reference format can be reused for other tasks
- buildComponent2.prompt.md stays up-to-date with learnings

## Next Steps

1. Mark P0-001 as complete in component-backlog.md: `[ ]` → `[x]`
2. Begin P0-002 Typography System Setup using updated workflow
3. Continue documenting completions in progress/ folder
4. Archive additional fix notes as tasks complete
5. Keep buildComponent2.prompt.md updated with new learnings
