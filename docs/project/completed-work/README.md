## Purpose

This folder keeps completed work documentation organized without cluttering the main docs folder. Each completed task gets:
- Quick reference guide (one-page)
- Executive summary (high-level overview)
- Cleanup/process notes (if applicable)

Full technical documentation stays in `docs/progress/` for detailed reference.
