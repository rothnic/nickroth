## Conventions

- Create new guides as Markdown files in this directory.
- Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `topic-name.md`).
- Update this index and the root `README.md` when adding or renaming docs so agents always have an up-to-date map.
- Add new categories when you introduce guides that do not fit existing ones; keep related topics grouped together.
