# Scroll Performance Optimizations

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Grid Background Optimizations

## Problem

Chrome DevTools Performance recording showed heavy main thread activity during scrolling:
- 81.1% profiling overhead (expected during recording)
- 7.5% commit (rendering work)
- 3.2% function calls
- Constant vertical bars indicating JavaScript execution competing with smooth scrolling
- **Visible stutter** when scrolling, especially at top/bottom of page

## Root Causes

### Primary: Complex Grid Background

The `#grid-bg` element had **4 stacked gradients** being repainted during scroll:

1. Large radial gradient (ellipse at top left) - `100% x 100%`
2. Complex diagonal linear gradient with 5 color stops - `100% x 100%`
3. Vertical grid lines - `16px x 16px`
4. Horizontal grid lines - `16px x 16px`

**Problem**: All four gradients in a single `background-image` property = expensive composite operation on every scroll frame.

### Secondary: Positioning Issues

- Originally `position: absolute` inside scrolling `<body>`
- While visually stationary, it was still in the scroll calculation
- Browser had to manage it during overscroll/bounce at page boundaries

### Additional Issues

2. **Lack of CSS containment** on cards and heavy elements
3. **Full-page view transitions** instead of scoped shared-element transitions (NOT YET ADDRESSED)
4. **Missing prefetch** for work detail pages on card hover

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Split Gradients into Separate Layers (`src/styles/global.css`)

**Before** (slow - single element with 4 backgrounds):
```css
#grid-bg {
    background-image: 
        radial-gradient(...),      /* Layer 1 */
        linear-gradient(135deg...), /* Layer 2 */
        linear-gradient(...),       /* Layer 3 - vertical grid */
        linear-gradient(90deg...);  /* Layer 4 - horizontal grid */
}
```

**After** (fast - 3 elements each composited separately):
```css
/* Main element - grid pattern only */
#grid-bg {
    position: fixed;  /* Removed from scroll calculation */
    background-image: 
        linear-gradient(...),       /* Vertical grid */
        linear-gradient(90deg...);  /* Horizontal grid */
    transform: translateZ(0);       /* GPU layer */
    contain: strict;                /* Paint isolation */
}

/* Radial gradient - separate layer */
#grid-bg::before {
    background-image: radial-gradient(...);
    transform: translateZ(0);  /* Own GPU layer */
}

/* Diagonal gradient - separate layer */
#grid-bg::after {
    background-image: linear-gradient(135deg...);
    transform: translateZ(0);  /* Own GPU layer */
    opacity: 0.8;              /* Reduce paint complexity */
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Each gradient composited independently on GPU
- Simple grid pattern on main element can use cached tiles
- Complex gradients isolated to pseudo-elements

### 2. Fixed Positioning (`src/styles/global.css`)

Changed from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed`:

```css
#grid-bg {
    position: fixed;  /* Viewport-fixed, not scroll-relative */
    inset: 0;
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Completely removed from scroll calculation
- Browser never repaints it during scroll
- No recalculation at top/bottom bounce

### 3. GPU Layer Promotion

Added explicit GPU hints to all gradient layers:

```css
transform: translateZ(0);        /* Force GPU layer */
will-change: transform;          /* Optimize for changes */
backface-visibility: hidden;     /* Disable 3D flip */
perspective: 1000px;             /* Enable 3D context */
contain: strict;                 /* Total isolation */
```

**Impact**: Browser creates separate compositor layer, bypassing main thread paint.

### 4. Overscroll Behavior (`src/styles/global.css`)

Added to prevent bounce stutter:

```css
html {
    overscroll-behavior-y: none;  /* No rubber-band effect */
}
```

**Impact**: Eliminates extra paint work when hitting scroll boundaries.

### 5. Background Grid Persistence (`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`)

Already working from previous changes:

```astro
<div transition:persist="background-grid" id="grid-bg" aria-hidden="true"></div>
```

**Impact**: Grid never re-renders during page navigation.

### 6. Hover Prefetch (`src/components/WorkCard.astro`)

Added prefetch for instant navigation:

```astro
<a 
  href={`/work/${slug}`}
  data-astro-prefetch="hover"
>
```

**Impact**: Work detail pages load instantly on hover.

## Validation Steps

1. **Test scroll performance**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools → Performance
   - Record while scrolling homepage
   - Check for reduced "Commit" percentage (should be <5%)
   - Verify smoother 60fps timeline

2. **Test view transitions**:
   - Navigate from homepage to work detail
   - Verify only image/title animate (not full card)
   - Check that grid background stays static (no flash)
   - Confirm smooth transition without shadow judder

3. **Test prefetch**:
   - Hover over work card
   - Open Network tab
   - Verify prefetch request for detail page
   - Navigate and note instant load

4. **Test on mobile**:
   - Test on actual device (not just emulator)
   - Verify smooth scroll
   - Check transition performance with CPU throttling

## Before/After Metrics

### Expected Improvements

- **Scroll FPS**: 45-50fps → 58-60fps
- **Commit time**: 7.5% → <3%
- **View transition duration**: Perceived smoother (same duration, less jank)
- **Navigation speed**: 200-300ms faster on hover-prefetch

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

These are additional optimizations from the original recommendations:

### Priority 2: Theme Picker Lazy Loading
- [ ] Move theme selector to lazy-loaded component
- [ ] Only render current theme by default
- [ ] Mount full picker on click

### Priority 3: Work Detail Page Optimization
- [ ] Verify hero images use `loading="eager"` and `fetchpriority="high"`
- [ ] Add `aspect-ratio` to hero containers to prevent CLS
- [ ] Ensure proper `srcset/sizes` for responsive images

### Priority 4: Font Loading
- [ ] Verify `font-display: swap` is active
- [ ] Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for Google Fonts (already present)
- [ ] Consider self-hosting fonts for faster FOFT
