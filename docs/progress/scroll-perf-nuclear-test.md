# Emergency Scroll Performance Diagnostic

## Current State: NUCLEAR TEST

I've disabled EVERYTHING that could possibly cause scroll stutter:

```css
*, *::before, *::after {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
}
```

Plus:
- ❌ No gradient overlays
- ❌ No GPU hints
- ❌ No transform properties
- ❌ No transitions
- ❌ No animations

### If Still Stuttering

The problem is NOT CSS-related. It's likely one of:

#### 1. Browser Issue
Test in different browsers:
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Safari  
- [ ] Firefox

If only Chrome stutters → Chrome-specific issue

#### 2. Hardware Acceleration Disabled

Check chrome://gpu in Chrome:
```
Graphics Feature Status
- Canvas: Hardware accelerated
- Compositing: Hardware accelerated
- Multiple Raster Threads: Enabled
- Rasterization: Hardware accelerated
```

If any say "Software only" → Hardware acceleration problem

#### 3. Display Scaling/Resolution

MacBook Pro Retina displays can cause issues:
- Check System Preferences → Displays
- Try "Default" instead of "Scaled"
- Test on external monitor

#### 4. Background Processes

Check Activity Monitor:
- Sort by % CPU
- Look for processes using >10% during scroll
- WindowServer using high CPU? → macOS graphics issue

#### 5. Dev Server Issue

The Astro dev server might be causing HMR (Hot Module Replacement) checks:

```bash
# Build and serve production
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

Test scroll in production build. If smooth → Dev server was the issue.

#### 6. Chrome Extensions

```bash
# Open in incognito (disables most extensions)
# Cmd+Shift+N in Chrome
```

Test scroll in incognito. If smooth → Extension was interfering.

#### 7. The Nuclear Option: Blank Page Test

Create a minimal test page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body {
            background: white;
            height: 3000px;
            background-image: 
                linear-gradient(#ddd 1px, transparent 1px),
                linear-gradient(90deg, #ddd 1px, transparent 1px);
            background-size: 16px 16px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Scroll Test</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

If THIS stutters → System-level issue, not your code.

## Most Likely Culprits at This Point

1. **Dev server HMR** (50%) - Build production and test
2. **Chrome extension** (20%) - Test in incognito
3. **Hardware acceleration** (15%) - Check chrome://gpu
4. **Display scaling** (10%) - Check System Preferences
5. **Background process** (5%) - Check Activity Monitor

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Test production build
pnpm build
pnpm preview
# Then open http://localhost:4321

# Check if dev server is the problem
# Compare scroll in dev (port 4322) vs preview (port 4321)
```

## If Production Build Is Smooth

The dev server's HMR is causing the stutter. Solutions:

1. **Accept it** - Dev servers are always slower
2. **Disable HMR**:
   ```js
   // astro.config.mjs
   export default defineConfig({
     vite: {
       server: {
         hmr: false
       }
     }
   });
   ```
3. **Use production preview during testing**

## Report Back

Tell me:
1. Does it stutter in **production preview** (pnpm preview)?
2. Does it stutter in **incognito mode**?
3. What does **chrome://gpu** show?
4. Does a **blank HTML file** with just a grid background stutter?
