# Progress Documentation

## Purpose
Active work logs and running progress notes documenting the development process. This folder contains chronological records of implementation work, debugging sessions, and iterative improvements.

## Contents
Progress logs covering:
- **Badge System**: Refinements, sizing updates, and rotation improvements
- **Hero Section**: DaisyUI migration and corrections
- **Performance**: Scroll performance diagnosis, testing, and optimizations
- **Global CSS**: Foundation setup and refactoring work
- **Component Development**: Detailed implementation notes

## Conventions
- Date-prefixed files for chronological tracking: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- Descriptive names indicating the feature/component worked on
- Include problem description, solution, and results
- Keep running notes during active development

## Usage
- Files in this folder represent **active or recent work**
- Once work is completed and validated, summarize in `../project/completed-work/`
- Historical or superseded approaches should be moved to `../archive/`
