# Building an Astro Portfolio with AI-Assisted Development

## Impact Statement
A case study in modern web development: leveraging Figma Make prototypes, AI coding agents, and Astro view transitions to build a performant portfolio site.

## Overview

This personal portfolio site is itself a case study in modern web development practices. Rather than a traditional build process, it leveraged Figma Make for rapid prototyping, AI coding agents for conversion and implementation, and Astro's view transitions for a polished SPA-like experience.

## What Makes This Site Different

### AI-Assisted Design Evolution

This site's design workflow has evolved through multiple AI design tools:

**Initial Approach (Figma Make)**: The site started as a prototype generated with Figma Make, which exported a React codebase. AI coding agents converted this to Astro components.

**Current Approach (Google Stitch)**: Design iteration now uses [Google Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/), which generates framework-agnostic HTML/CSS. This eliminates the React-to-Astro conversion step and enables faster iteration on visual designs.

For a detailed comparison of AI design tools, see [AI-Assisted Design: From Prompt to Production](/work/ai-assisted-design).

### Astro View Transitions
The site uses Astro's [ClientRouter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) for smooth, app-like navigation without JavaScript frameworks. Astro provides [transition directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#transition-directives) like `transition:name`, `transition:animate`, and `transition:persist` to control how elements behave during navigation.

**Navbar Persistence**: The navigation bar uses [`transition:name="main-navbar"`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#naming-a-transition) to remain stable during page transitions, with individual nav links animated via `transition:name` for active state morphing.

**Work Card Animations**: Project cards on `/work` use coordinated transitions:
- `transition:name="work-card-{slug}"` - Card container morphs to detail page
- `transition:name="work-img-{slug}"` - Hero image expands seamlessly
- `transition:name="work-title-{slug}"` - Title text transitions in place
- `transition:name="work-body-{slug}"` - Content area animates smoothly

This creates a shared-element expansion effect where clicking a project card feels like zooming into the detail page.

**URL-Based Category Filtering**: Rather than client-side JavaScript filtering, categories use static routes:
- `/work` - All projects
- `/work/category/web-platforms` - Filtered by category
- `/work/resume-chatbot` - Project detail

This approach provides:
- **SEO-friendly URLs** - Each category is a crawlable page
- **Shareable links** - Users can share filtered views
- **No JavaScript required** - Works with JS disabled
- **Proper view transitions** - Cards animate seamlessly between all/filtered/detail views

## Neobrutalism Design System

The site implements a custom neobrutalism theme through DaisyUI overrides:

- **Bold borders** - 2-4px solid black borders on all interactive elements
- **Hard shadows** - Offset box shadows (4px 4px) for depth without blur
- **Vibrant colors** - High-saturation accent colors (magenta, yellow, cyan)
- **Uppercase typography** - Headlines use uppercase with tight tracking
- **Chunky components** - Cards, badges, and buttons with generous padding

## View Transitions Deep Dive

### Navigation Active State Morphing

The navbar implements a morphing active indicator that smoothly moves between nav items during page transitions. Here's the actual implementation:

**Navbar Component Structure:**

```astro
<!-- Navbar.astro -->
<nav class="btn-group h-full items-center relative">
  {topLevelNavItems.map((item) => (
    <a 
      href={item.href} 
      class={topLevelLinkClass(item.href)}
      transition:name={`nav-link-${item.href.slice(1)}`}
    >
      {isActive(item.href) && (
        <span 
          class="nav-active-bg" 
          transition:name="nav-active-bg"
        />
      )}
      <span class="relative z-10">{item.label}</span>
    </a>
  ))}
</nav>
```

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Per-link transition names**: Each link gets `transition:name={nav-link-work}`, `transition:name={nav-link-approach}`, etc. This allows Astro to track each link's position across pages.

2. **Shared active background**: The `nav-active-bg` span only renders on the active link, but uses a **shared** `transition:name="nav-active-bg"`. When navigating from `/work` to `/background`, the background element "moves" from one link to another.

3. **Z-index layering**: The text uses `relative z-10` to sit above the morphing background.

**CSS Animations for View Transitions:**

```css
/* BaseLayout.astro <style> block */
@keyframes scale-up {
  from { transform: scale(0.8); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes scale-down {
  from { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  to { transform: scale(0.8); opacity: 0; }
}
```

### Project Card Expansion

When navigating from `/work` to `/work/[slug]`:

1. The card's hero image matches the detail page hero via shared `transition:name`
2. The title and body content animate from card positions to full-width layout
3. Browser calculates geometry changes and animates position/size automatically

### Lifecycle Hooks

The site uses Astro's view transition lifecycle events for state management:

**ClientRouter Setup (BaseLayout.astro):**

```astro
<head>
  <!-- Enable SPA-style navigation -->
  <ClientRouter />
</head>
```

**Dark Mode Sync:**

```js
document.addEventListener("astro:before-swap", (event) => {
  event.newDocument.documentElement.dataset.theme =
    localStorage.getItem("color-scheme") || "light";
});
```

**Re-initializing Scripts After Navigation:**

With view transitions, `DOMContentLoaded` only fires on the initial page load. For interactive elements (like category filters), use `astro:page-load`:

```js
function initCategoryFilter() {
  const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('[data-category]');
  // ... filter logic
}

// Initial load
initCategoryFilter();

// After view transitions
document.addEventListener('astro:page-load', initCategoryFilter);
```

This pattern ensures interactive scripts work both on initial load and after SPA-style navigation.

## AI-Assisted Development

This site was primarily built using AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude, Antigravity) with specific patterns:

- **Component extraction** - Agents extracted reusable patterns from Figma export
- **Content separation** - All content moved to `src/content/` collections
- **AGENTS.md guidance** - Project-specific instructions for AI collaborators
- **Iterative refinement** - Rapid feedback loops between human and AI

## Lessons Learned

- **Figma Make as reference** - Export quality varies, but it's excellent as a translation reference
- **View transitions require planning** - Element naming must be consistent across pages
- **Neobrutalism is opinionated** - Hard shadows and bold borders need careful balance
- **AI agents need structure** - AGENTS.md and clear file organization accelerate development
