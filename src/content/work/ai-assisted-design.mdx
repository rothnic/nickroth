# AI-Assisted Design: From Prompt to Production

## The Landscape in 2025

AI-powered design tools have matured beyond generating static mockups. The current generation produces **usable code**—components that can be integrated directly into production applications or used as authoritative references for implementation.

Three tools dominate the space, each with distinct strengths:

| Tool | Primary Output | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Google Stitch | UI designs + code export | Framework-agnostic prototyping |
| Vercel v0 | React/Next.js components | Shadcn/Tailwind projects |
| Figma AI (Make) | Design mockups + prototypes | Designer-developer handoff |

## Google Stitch

[Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) (from Google Labs) generates web and mobile UI designs from text prompts or images.

### Strengths

- **Framework-agnostic export** — Generates HTML/CSS that works with any framework
- **Multi-screen generation** — Creates entire application flows, not just single components
- **Style modification** — Tweak colors, typography, and layout after generation
- **Figma export** — Send designs to Figma for refinement with your team
- **Rapid iteration** — Generate multiple variants quickly to explore design directions

### Workflow Integration

Stitch excels at the **ideation phase**. Use it to:

1. Generate initial component layouts from rough descriptions
2. Export as code for reference implementation
3. Adapt the generated patterns to your design system

The export is framework-agnostic, making it suitable for Astro sites that avoid React dependencies.

## Vercel v0

[v0](https://v0.dev/) from Vercel generates production-ready React components from natural language prompts.

### Strengths

- **Production-ready code** — Components work immediately
- **Tailwind CSS styling** — Consistent with modern styling approaches
- **Shadcn UI integration** — Pre-built component patterns
- **Conversational refinement** — Iterate on designs through dialogue

### Limitations for Non-React Projects

v0's output is tightly coupled to its ecosystem:

- **React-specific** — Components require React runtime
- **Shadcn dependency** — Assumes Shadcn UI component library
- **Next.js patterns** — File structure assumes Next.js conventions

For Astro sites aiming for minimal JavaScript, v0's output requires significant adaptation:

```javascript
// v0 output (React)
export function Card({ title, children }) {
  return (
    <div className="rounded-lg border bg-card p-6">
      <h3 className="font-semibold">{title}</h3>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

// Astro adaptation
---
const { title } = Astro.props;
---
<div class="rounded-lg border bg-card p-6">
  <h3 class="font-semibold">{title}</h3>
  <slot />
</div>
```

Use v0 when you need **design inspiration** or are working within the React/Next.js ecosystem. For Astro projects, treat v0 output as a reference implementation rather than copy-paste code.

## Figma AI (Make Designs)

Figma's AI features integrate directly into the design tool, generating mockups and automating repetitive tasks.

### Strengths

- **Native integration** — Works within your existing Figma workflow
- **Team collaboration** — Generated designs are immediately shareable
- **Prototype wiring** — Connects screens into interactive prototypes
- **Content generation** — Real copy instead of lorem ipsum

### When to Use

Figma AI is ideal when:
- Your team already uses Figma as the source of truth
- You need stakeholder-ready mockups
- Designer-developer handoff is a bottleneck

For solo developer projects, Stitch often provides faster iteration since it outputs code directly.

## Choosing the Right Tool

### For Framework-Agnostic Projects (Astro, Hugo, 11ty)

**Google Stitch** — Framework-agnostic output means less adaptation work. Export as HTML/CSS and integrate into your static site generator.

### For React/Next.js Projects

**Vercel v0** — Components work immediately. The Shadcn integration provides consistent patterns.

### For Team-Based Design Workflows

**Figma AI** — Keeps everything in your existing design system. Designers and developers share a single source of truth.

## The Evolution from Figma Make

This portfolio site originally used **Figma Make** (the code export feature) as a starting point. The workflow was:

1. Generate a React prototype with Figma Make
2. Use AI coding agents to convert React → Astro
3. Manually extract patterns and adapt to DaisyUI

With **Google Stitch**, the workflow becomes:

1. Generate UI concepts from prompts
2. Export as HTML/CSS or send to Figma
3. Adapt styling to your design system (DaisyUI, Tailwind, etc.)

The key improvement: Stitch's output is **framework-agnostic**, eliminating the React-to-Astro conversion step.

## Practical Tips

**Start with constraints** — Provide specific requirements in your prompt:
> "Category filter bar, horizontal scroll, pill-shaped buttons, active state with accent color, neobrutalism style with hard shadows"

**Iterate in the tool** — Use multi-turn prompts to refine:
> "Make the shadow offset larger, use a magenta accent color, uppercase text"

**Export early** — Don't over-polish in the AI tool. Export once you have the general structure, then refine in code where you have precise control.

**Maintain design tokens** — Whatever tool you use, map AI-generated colors and spacing to your design system variables. This ensures consistency as you iterate.
