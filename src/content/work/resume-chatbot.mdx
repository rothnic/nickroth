# AI-Powered Resume Builder with Real-Time Streaming

## Impact Statement
A sophisticated AI resume editor featuring real-time streaming updates and surgical JSON patching for seamless collaborative editing.

## Overview

A sophisticated AI-powered resume editor that enables real-time, chat-based resume creation and optimization. The system uses surgical JSON patching (RFC 6902) to apply incremental updates as the AI generates content, creating a collaborative editing experience similar to Google Docs.

## Key Features

- **Real-time streaming** - Watch content appear as the AI generates it
- **Surgical updates** - Only modified fields update, preserving context
- **Intelligent suggestions** - AI understands resume best practices
- **Artifact system** - Side-by-side chat and resume preview

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and App Router
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK with multi-provider support
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with Framer Motion animations
- **Database**: Postgres (Neon Serverless) via Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth.js) v5 Beta
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry with Vercel/SigNoz integration

## Core Architecture

### Surgical JSON Patching
Instead of replacing entire document content on each update, the system generates RFC 6902 JSON Patches that target specific fields. This enables:
- Minimal UI re-renders for better performance
- Precise scroll-to-edit behavior highlighting changes
- Efficient undo/redo operations

### Deterministic Tool Governance
In multi-tool AI systems, overlapping capabilities create ambiguity. This project implements hard blocking at the code level:
- `createDocument` owns initialization
- `patchResume` owns resume modifications (surgical)
- `updateDocument` owns generic documents (text, code)

### Streaming Infrastructure
The system leverages Vercel AI SDK's `partialObjectStream` to emit partial JSON objects as the model generates tokens. Custom filtering ensures patches are only applied once values have stabilized.

## Development Patterns

### E2E Testing Strategy
Playwright tests are the source of truth, implementing:
- **Synchronized readiness** via `body.hydrated` markers
- **Streaming completion detection** through status attributes
- **Animation vs. functional separation** for reliable tests

### Prompt Engineering
The AI uses structured prompts with:
- Dynamic context injection for resume sections
- Verbatim formatting rules for consistency
- Task aggregation to batch related updates

## Lessons Learned

- **Partial object streaming** enables typewriter-style UX without custom infrastructure
- **Tool governance** at code level is more reliable than prompt engineering alone
- **JSON Patch** provides surgical precision that full-document updates cannot match
- **End-state verification** in tests is more stable than intermediate checks
