# AI-Powered Resume Builder with Real-Time Streaming

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> PROBLEM:</span> <span class="h2-title">Document drift in conversational editors</span>

Conversational editors that regenerate entire documents cause document drift. Small changes accumulate: duplicated sections, format loss, and stealth reordering. For resumes, these errors are costly.

<div class="not-prose tldr-block">
  <p class="tldr-label">TL;DR</p>
  <p class="tldr-content">AI streams surgical JSON patches targeting specific fields - like changing just your job title - without touching anything else. Instant updates, zero formatting loss.</p>
</div>

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> ARCHITECTURE:</span> <span class="h2-title">Three-layer streaming pipeline</span>

High-level runtime: a single-purpose pipeline with clear boundaries. Each layer has one responsibility so reasoning, testing, and failure modes remain isolated.

### Layers

- **Conversation Agent:** handles intent reasoning and tool routing.
- **Patch Tool:** emits RFC 6902 operations from structured requests.
- **Patch Application:** validates and applies safe mutations in the client.

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> STREAM SEMANTICS:</span> <span class="h2-title">Text vs object/tool-call streams</span>

Streaming raw text and streaming structured objects are different contracts. Text streams carry language; object streams carry typed operations. Treat object streams as authoritative, validate them, and avoid re-parsing textual tokens into state.

- **Text stream contract:** human-facing output for explanation and conversational flow.
- **Object/tool-call contract:** machine-facing operations for precise, schema-valid state updates.

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> DEMO:</span> <span class="h2-title">What it shows</span>

The demo showcases surgical RFC 6902 patches arriving progressively and being applied without full-document replacements. It demonstrates reduced UI churn, preserved formatting, and deterministic application under mock providers.

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> TESTING:</span> <span class="h2-title">Strategy and results</span>

Testing splits into deterministic model mocks and schema assertions. Replace external model calls with mock providers, then assert final resume JSON against the schema rather than fragile UI timings.

- **Deterministic mocks:** remove network and model variability from primary checks.
- **Schema assertions:** verify final JSON correctness without timing fragility.

Results:

<ul class="comparable-list">
  <li><span class="metric-label metric-before">Before</span> <span class="metric-value metric-before">~50%</span> stability, <span class="stat-callout stat-negative">28.8s</span> avg per test</li>
  <li><span class="metric-label metric-after">After</span> <span class="metric-value metric-after">100%</span> stability, <span class="stat-callout stat-positive">9.2s</span> avg per test</li>
</ul>

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> HANDOFF:</span> <span class="h2-title">Deep dives and next reading</span>

This page is an overview and hub. Follow the deep dives for implementation detail and test patterns.

- [Streaming JSON Patching Architecture](/work/resume-chatbot-streaming-architecture): detailed pipeline internals, stabilization mechanics, and operation lifecycle.
- [Deterministic Testing for AI Streaming](/work/resume-chatbot-testing-strategy): mock-provider design, synchronization strategy, and reliability benchmarks.

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> NOTES:</span> <span class="h2-title">Implementation and caveats</span>

- **Progressive stream:** use `partialObjectStream` for incremental structured payloads.
- **Validation first:** verify operations with `fast-json-patch` before mutation.
- **Stable emission:** keep the patch model fixed for predictable operation shape.
- **Safety fallback:** for large destructive edits, use guarded full-document operations.

## <span class="h2-prefix"><span class="h2-hash">##</span> LESSONS:</span> <span class="h2-title">What we learned</span>

- **Streaming partial objects:** reduces perceived latency and UI churn.
- **Clear boundaries:** make debugging and testing substantially easier.
- **Schema validation:** prevents invalid model operations from corrupting state.
- **Deterministic mocks:** are required for fast, stable E2E reliability.
