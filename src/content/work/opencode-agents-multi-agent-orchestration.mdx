# Multi-Agent Orchestration for Autonomous Software Development

## Impact Statement
A test-driven framework where specialized AI agents collaborate autonomously, with measurable performance benchmarks proving actual improvement over single-agent approaches.

## Overview

OpenCode Agents explores the frontier of agentic AI for software development. Unlike single-agent coding assistants, this system orchestrates multiple specialized agents—each with distinct responsibilities and permissions—working together to build software autonomously.

The project addresses a critical gap in AI-assisted development: **How do you prove agents actually work?** Every capability includes verification tests with boolean checks and performance metrics.

## The Problem with Single-Agent Coding

Most AI coding tools use a single agent model that handles everything: planning, implementation, testing, and documentation. This creates several problems:

- **Context drift** during long tasks
- **Quality degradation** as complexity increases
- **No specialization** for distinct concerns
- **Unmeasurable improvement** over time

## Multi-Agent Architecture

The system implements a team of specialized agents with clear boundaries:

| Agent | Role | Permissions |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Task decomposition & coordination | Read-only, planning |
| **Code Implementer** | Write application code | Full write access |
| **Test Writer** | Generate and run tests | Write + limited bash |
| **Security Auditor** | Scan for vulnerabilities | Read-only |
| **DocuWriter** | Create documentation | Write docs only |
| **MemoryFormation** | Extract learnings | Memory tool access |

Each agent operates with minimal permissions necessary for its role—a security-first approach that prevents accidental damage while enabling autonomous operation.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Test-First Verification
Every agent capability is validated through automated tests:
- File existence and syntax validation
- Functional correctness testing
- Test coverage requirements (≥80%)
- Code quality checks (no critical linting errors)

### Measurable Performance Targets

| Phase | Token Efficiency | Quality | Success Rate |
|-------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| Baseline | < 500 tokens | N/A | 100% |
| Two-Agent | ≤ 130% single | ≥ 80% | ≥ 95% |
| With Memory | 20-30% reduction | ≥ 90% | ≥ 95% |
| Complex Tasks | < 20,000 tokens | ≥ 90% | ≥ 85% |

### Defense-in-Depth Quality Gates
The system implements multiple layers of validation that prevent incomplete work:
- Pre-commit hooks for syntax and linting
- Automated test execution before merge
- Coverage thresholds enforced at CI level
- Security scanning on every PR

### Adaptive Memory System
Agents learn from previous work through a vector-based memory system:
- **Semantic storage** for solution patterns
- **Context retrieval** to reuse past approaches
- **Learning loop** that improves efficiency over time

## Development Journey

This project is documented through a **16-post blog series** capturing real insights from each development phase:

1. Why Most AI Coding Projects Fail
2. Building Quality Gates: Defense-in-Depth
3. Test Evidence: Proving agents work
4. The Orchestrator Pattern
5. Two-Agent Collaboration
6. Permission Systems: Trust but verify
7. Building Memory Systems
8. The Learning Loop

## Early Results

**Phase 0.2 findings:**
- ✅ Quality gates prevent 100% of designed failure modes
- ✅ Defense-in-depth creates resilient boundaries
- ✅ Timestamped test evidence proves execution
- ✅ Automated enforcement >>> documentation alone

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ / TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: OpenCode CLI with GitHub Copilot models
- **Benchmarking**: Evalite for measurable performance
- **Testing**: Vitest with custom metrics collection
- **Memory**: Vector database for semantic storage

## Lessons Learned

- **Multi-agent beats single-agent** for complex tasks when properly orchestrated
- **Measurable targets** reveal improvement that qualitative assessment misses
- **Permission boundaries** are essential for autonomous operation at scale
- **Memory systems** dramatically reduce token usage for repeated patterns
- **Test evidence** is the only reliable proof that agents work

## What's Next

The framework is progressing toward an installable npm package that can transform any project into an AI-assisted development environment:

```bash
# Future installation (coming soon)
npm install -g opencode-agents
cd my-project
opencode-agents init
```

This project represents the intersection of AI engineering and software craftsmanship—proving that the future of development isn't just AI-assisted, it's AI-collaborative.
