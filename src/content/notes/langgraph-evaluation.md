# Evaluating LangGraph for Multi-Step Workflows

Spent the week evaluating LangGraph for orchestrating complex AI workflows that require multiple LLM calls, external API integrations, and conditional branching. Key findings:

## Key Findings

• **State Management**: Excellent persistence across workflow steps, much better than manual state tracking in LangChain
• **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error routing make workflows more robust
• **Human-in-Loop**: Easy integration points for human review and intervention
• **Debugging**: Visual workflow representation helps troubleshoot complex flows

## Next Steps
Planning pilot implementation for content review workflow that currently requires 3-4 manual steps. Initial tests show 70% automation potential while maintaining quality standards.

## Recommendation
LangGraph worth the learning curve for any multi-step AI workflows. The state management alone saves significant development time.
